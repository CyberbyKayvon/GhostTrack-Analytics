# GhostTrack

**GhostTrack** is an open-source, privacy-aware, security-focused behavioral analytics platform designed for web developers and cybersecurity professionals.

It helps site owners and engineers understand not only *what* users are doing on their site, but *who might be abusing it* — by detecting scraping, bots, automation, credential stuffing, and other anomalies — all without compromising user privacy.

## Why GhostTrack?

Modern web analytics focuses on marketing and advertising. Meanwhile, advanced behavioral security tooling is locked behind enterprise platforms that charge $5,000–$50,000 per month — and offer no transparency or control.

**GhostTrack fills that gap** by offering:

- **Clickstream analytics** with user session replay, scroll/click maps, and timing data
- **Bot and anomaly detection** using fingerprinting, heuristics, and IP metadata
- **Self-hostability** so your user data stays yours
- **Privacy-first design** (no 3rd party cookies, anonymized IPs, opt-out modes)
- **Security tooling** that lets you detect automated threats at the behavioral level

## Core Features

- Pageview and session tracking
- Click and scroll depth logging
- Session time-on-page tracking
- Basic mouse movement tracking
- Lightweight device fingerprinting (via canvas, screen size, plugins, etc.)
- Geolocation from IP address (IPinfo or MaxMind)
- Bot/anomaly detection rules:
  - Excessive page views in short time
  - No user interaction (indicative of headless bots)
  - Known bad user-agents
  - Suspicious scroll/click ratios
  - Tor/VPN/proxy detection
- SQLite or PostgreSQL backend storage
- Admin dashboard to view sessions and alerts
- Email/Discord/Slack alerting for high-risk sessions
- Toggleable "privacy mode" for GDPR/CCPA compliance

## Architecture Overview

Client Browser
|
|-- ghosttrack.js (frontend script)
| → Sends events: pageview, click, scroll, unload, etc.
|
↓
Backend API (Flask or FastAPI)
- Receives and validates tracking data
- Stores in database
- Applies detection rules
- Sends alerts (optional)
|
↓
Database (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
- Stores sessions, events, fingerprints, flags
|
↓
Dashboard (Streamlit / Flask Admin / React)
- View sessions, IP data, flagged anomalies

## MVP Roadmap for E-commerce Security Analytics

### Week 1-2: Core Tracking
- [ ] JavaScript tracking snippet (pageviews, events, basic fingerprinting)
- [ ] Backend API to receive events (Python/FastAPI)
- [ ] PostgreSQL database setup
- [ ] Basic bot detection (rate limiting, suspicious user agents)

### Week 3: Dashboard V1
- [ ] Login system (just basic auth for now)
- [ ] Simple dashboard showing:
  - Visitor count
  - Bot detection count
  - Threat feed (live list of blocked requests)
  - Basic chart (visitors over time)

### Week 4: E-commerce Specific
- [ ] Add "Add to Cart" event tracking
- [ ] Failed payment attempt detection
- [ ] Price check pattern detection
- [ ] Alert system (email when threshold hit)

### Month 2: Polish
- [ ] Better dashboard UI
- [ ] Shopify plugin/integration
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Deploy somewhere (DigitalOcean $12/month)

### Month 3: Testing
- [ ] Put it on YOUR sites first
- [ ] Reach out to 5-10 e-commerce friends to test
- [ ] Gather feedback
- [ ] Iterate
